In this project, we have created and App which fetches data about movies from TMDB API and displays the result on the screen.

On home Screen the app shows Now Playing Movies and Trending movies.

A User can search for a movie and will get the names, details and poster of the requested movie.

A User can mark any movie as their favourite and that will be stored in Datatabase using Room, which can be fetched afterwards.

Also a user can mark any movie from favourites to not favourite. 

Favorite ovies are also available offline as they are stored in the database.

On clicking on anymovie item, details about them are shown and a button to mark as favourite  or not favourite.
